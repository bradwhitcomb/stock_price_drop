### This script tracks a portfolio of stocks.  Stocks go up and down in value but hopefully more up than down.  
    
### Starting from the day that you add a stock into your portfolio this script logs the high price based on closing price and then calculates any drop in price and provides a report showing the percentage drop in price to help you decide if you should sell the stock.

## Here is how the code is built:
    - Import yahoo finance, pandas, collections and pickle.
    - Use the yahoo finance api to create a nested dictionary of stock prices.
    - Display the data in a pandas dataframe
    - Create a for loop that
        - pickles the data
        - determines high price
        - calculates percentage change
        - recreate the dictionary/dataframe to display new data
